# Backlog campaign tracker

One issue per session. Protocol: restore → take the cursor issue → feature-branch
lifecycle → advance cursor → append session log → write handover.

Default branch is `dev`; every issue merges there and `dev` is then
fast-forwarded into `main`. A session is not finished until both are pushed.

## Cursor

**Next issue: COS-2** — queue order confirmed by the user on 2026-08-16, who
chose the "Safety-first" option from a presented comparison: "COS-6 → COS-3 →
COS-2 → COS-8 → COS-5 → COS-7 → COS-1 → COS-4. Free doc task proves the loop,
then harness plumbing, then the caps guard, then measurement, then the two hard
style tasks last — after COS-2 has built the reserve split they need for honest
validation."

Do not re-ask before taking the next item.

## Queue (confirmed order)

| # | Issue | Type | One-line note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | COS-2 | harness | Third split the optimizer never sees. The safety net later issues depend on. ~$3. |
| 4 | COS-8 | styles | Caps decision + a guard catching a style file disagreeing with its contract. ~$8. |
| 5 | COS-5 | measure | Haiku across all three styles. ~$5. |
| 6 | COS-7 | measure | Fable across all three styles. Most expensive tier, ~$20. |
| 7 | COS-1 | styles | Multi-tool sessions and open-ended decisions. Judge bar 65%, currently ~48%. ~$15. |
| 8 | COS-4 | styles | Beginner prose. Judge bar 70%, currently 45.9/48.4. Hardest. ~$20. |

Estimated remaining: ~$71. Spent so far: $0.75 (COS-6 cost nothing; COS-3 came in
well under its ~$2 budget because every proving run was kept to one style on
Haiku at one iteration).

## Resolved

| # | Issue | Status/date/session | Evidence summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | COS-6 | Task Done — 2026-08-16, session 1 | README-only. All 3 ACs checked against quoted README lines: name resolution from frontmatter `name:` with filename fallback, a "Confirm it loaded" section giving the behavioural check and the canary, and the silent-fallback statement. Scripted checks: all three frontmatter names appear verbatim in the README (3/3); both new doc links resolve. `npm --prefix harness test` 11/11; `lore check` 0 errors after `lore sync`. Review found 3 issues, all fixed on the branch. Merged as `0631c04`. |
| 2 | COS-3 | Task Done — 2026-08-16, session 2 | All 3 ACs proved against a real improve run on the reviewed code, `results/2026-08-16T15-04-22-436Z/` (beginner, Haiku, 2 cases, 1 iteration, 4 cells, $0.0919), after an earlier 18-cell run at `14-48-09` ($0.6097) established the same three identities on the first implementation. AC #1: all four per-iteration transcript files present including the reverted v1, and `rows.json` groups 1/1/1/1 across v0 and v1. AC #2: rows sum = `summary.json` totalCostUsd = `improve.json` spentUsd = 0.0919, the counter deleted in favour of `spendOf(rows)`. AC #3: `score --rows` reproduced the loop's logged 0.8 / 0.9 / 0.669 / 0.85 exactly, exit 0 with the API pointed at a dead socket and no new results directory; no-arg `score` finds an improve run unaided. Plain-run path unchanged (12-44-03 still 81.0% at $7.517). `npm --prefix harness test` 23/23 (12 new); `lore check` 0 errors. `/code-review high` found five issues, all real and all fixed on the branch. Merged as `1daff4d`. |

## Not queued — needs a human / blocked

None yet. See the risk policy below for how issues arrive here.

## Risk policy (confirmed by the user on 2026-08-16)

"Record and park." If COS-4 or COS-1 cannot reach its measured judge-score bar,
the session records every attempt and the scores actually reached in the task
notes, moves the issue to "Not queued" with that evidence as the reason, advances
the cursor, and continues. Nothing merges that does not meet its acceptance
criteria, and no session stalls waiting for a human.

Two issues carry known risk against that policy:

- **COS-4** asks beginner's judge score to exceed 70%. It measures 45.9 on Opus
  and 48.4 on Sonnet. Six optimizer rewrites have already failed at exactly this,
  so achievability is unproven even though the criterion is objectively testable.
- **COS-8** AC #1 is an audience judgement — whether a non-technical reader
  *should* get shorter sentences than a technical leader. A session can run the
  experiment and record a data-backed decision, but surface it for the user to
  ratify rather than deciding unilaterally.

## Session log

- 2026-08-16 — session 0 (init): inventoried COS-1 through COS-8, all eight
  classified agent-resolvable. Queue order and risk policy confirmed with the
  user. Tracker created as doc-1. `.claude/handovers/` gitignored and
  `archive/handovers/` created during skill adoption (aed40a2). Cursor armed at
  COS-6.
- 2026-08-16 — session 1: resolved COS-6 on `feature/COS-6`. No drift found at
  restore: `dev`, `main`, and both remotes were all level at 80bc691, no leftover
  branches, no open PRs. Rewrote README.md's Install section and added "How the
  style name resolves", "Confirm it loaded", and "Going deeper". Facts were
  lifted from the existing mechanics reference and install runbook rather than
  re-derived — no probing, no harness run, no cost. `lore sync` was needed after
  all: moving COS-6's status put the story's managed task block into drift, and
  `lore check` failed until it was reconciled (it also auto-commits the touched
  `backlog/` file — expect that commit on the branch). Cursor advanced to COS-3.
  `/code-review high` raised three issues, all real and all fixed before the PR:
  a `<PR_SHA>` placeholder committed into this tracker's resolved row; `/config`
  described as if it set the style globally when it writes a project-scoped
  `.claude/settings.local.json`; and the README's own level headings using an em
  dash where the literal style names use an ASCII hyphen — copying a heading
  would have produced exactly the silent Default fallback the section warns
  about. Worth carrying forward: reviewing docs against the failure they claim to
  prevent caught two traps that every automated gate passed.
  Merged via PR #1 (rebase) as `0631c04`; `dev` and `main` both pushed at that
  SHA, no branch litter, no open PRs.
- 2026-08-16 — session 2: resolved COS-3 on `feature/COS-3`. No drift at restore:
  `dev`, `main`, and both remotes level at 325d2b0, no leftover branches, PR #1
  merged and pruned. The design question the handover flagged — where improve
  rows should live — resolved in favour of writing them at
  `results/<stamp>/rows.json`, the exact path `score`'s `newestRows()` already
  globs, so `score` needed no change at all to satisfy AC #3. Rows carry an
  `iteration` tag; reverted iterations are persisted too. `spentUsd` deleted in
  favour of summing the rows. `improveStyle` gained three optional parameters —
  `rows` (a caller-supplied sink), `onRows` (flush callback) and `deps`
  ({ evaluate, rewrite }) — so the persistence could be unit-tested without
  spend and could survive a crash; 12 new cases in `harness/test/improve.test.mjs`.
  `/code-review high` found five issues, all real and all fixed before the PR.
  The serious one is worth carrying forward: writing an improve run's
  `summary.json` and `report.md` at the same paths and shapes a plain `run` uses
  made the loop's pooled mean — baseline plus every rejected candidate — look
  like a style's score, and the first evidence run's report headlined 63.0% for a
  style whose real measured figure was 65.4/71.6. That is the same class of trap
  as session 1's: a number that every automated gate passes and only a reader
  catches. Fixed by labelling rather than by hiding the file. Also found: a
  by-iteration table that averaged two styles' traces together, no spend recorded
  for a style that crashed, and rows flushed only between styles. Two smaller
  lessons: the `npm test` script named `checks.test.mjs` explicitly and would
  have silently skipped the new file (now globs `test/*.test.mjs`), and three
  docs asserted "improve persists no rows" as standing fact — found by grepping
  the docs for what the change made false, not by any gate. Left for the user to
  rule on: a pre-existing comment/code disagreement at `harness/src/improve.mjs`
  about whether a reverted iteration briefs from the failed attempt or the
  incumbent — the code does the latter, the comment claims the former. Total
  spend this session $0.75 across three proving runs. Merged via PR #2 (rebase) as
  `1daff4d`; `dev` and `main` both pushed at that SHA, no branch litter, no open
  PRs. Cursor advanced to COS-2.
