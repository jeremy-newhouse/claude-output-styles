## Backlog.md Workflow

This project uses Backlog.md for task and project management.

**For every user request in this project, run `backlog instructions overview` before answering or taking action.**

Use the overview to decide whether to search, read, create, or update Backlog tasks.

Before task lifecycle actions, read the matching detailed guide:
- `backlog instructions task-creation` before creating or splitting tasks
- `backlog instructions task-execution` before planning, changing status or assignee, adding a plan or implementation notes, or implementing task work
- `backlog instructions task-finalization` before checking acceptance criteria, writing final summaries, or moving tasks to terminal statuses

Use `backlog <command> --help` before running unfamiliar commands. Help shows options, fields, and examples.

Do not edit Backlog task, draft, document, decision, or milestone markdown files directly. Use the `backlog` CLI so metadata, relationships, and history stay consistent.

<!-- lore:agents:begin -->
This repo uses **lore** — an OKF-native documentation CLI — for the docs bundle under `docs/`.
When working on documentation, drive it through `lore` (not a plain editor) so Story <-> Task
coupling, managed blocks, and cross-links stay coherent.

- **Skill:** `.claude/skills/lore/SKILL.md` — how to drive lore.
- **Just-in-time detail:** run `lore instructions` for the canonical agent loop, then
  `lore instructions <topic>` (`linking`, `sync`, `check`, `validation`).
